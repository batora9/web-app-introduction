These graceful brown-and-white animals live with Stan and Amy Sanders at the Sanders Christmas Tree Farm in Greenfield County.<br/><br/>The reindeer were brought to the farm this September from their native Alaska. The Sanders' eight-year-old daughter Emily read a book about reindeer, and begged her parents to get one, Mr. Sanders explains. She argued that the traditional Christmas animals would attract more business to the farm in December. At first, the Sanders did not believe reindeer could live through the hot Illinois summers. Then they met a man in Indiana who raises the deer. He explained that they do fine so long as they have plenty of shade and water. So the Sanders gave in, and ordered a pair from a breeder in Alaska.<br/><br/>Now that December is here, little Emily's business instincts are proving to be sound. Families from all over the state are bringing their children to see the reindeer, and while they're at the farm, many go ahead and purchase their Christmas trees."

                      "　Traditionally, coffee houses in the United States have been of two varieties: the aesthetically oriented coffee shops <b>associated</b> with college campuses and urban art communities, and the classic American diner linked with America's working class and the culture of mobility based on ownership of private automobiles and a vast network of interstate highways.  Although a third type of coffee shop has recently emerged in American life ─ the coffee house franchise catering to middle class consumers ─ many in the United States would argue that <b>genuine</b> American culture is best encountered in the diners that can still be found along highways and in various cities throughout the country.  There is an authentic feel to diners which appeals to many.<br/><br/>　Many roadside diners were built to accommodate the needs of truck drivers and motorists filling America's highways as the United States began in the early and mid-twentieth century to shift from a reliance on railroads to a dependence on trucking fleets and private automobiles to move both the nation's commerce and its citizens.  Unlike earlier migrations in the 1930's, which were forced by economic depression and agricultural disasters in the middle and western states, the late 1940's and 1950's saw the development of a culture of mobility that embraced travel both as an engine of national prosperity and as a means of self-discovery.<br/><br/>　Because they drove long hours every day of the week, truck drivers did not maintain the predictable schedules followed by most American businesses and by middle class American families.  Truckers needed restaurants where <b>they</b> could purchase a meal at any hour of the day or night, and where they could stop for coffee in order to revive enough to drive several hundred more miles.  Roadside diners catered to these needs.<br/><br/>　Such diners also filled the needs of travelers attracted by the romance of the road celebrated in the 1950's and 1960's by writers such as Jack Kerouac and by television programs such as Route 66, a show about life along America's first transcontinental highway.  Movies such as The Wild One also depicted America's desire for speed and freedom.  The men and women pursuing private dreams along the interstate system which was helping to bind American regions more closely together into a national culture frequently found themselves sitting in a booth or at a counter in the early hours of the morning with red-eyed truckers, ordering coffee and a slice of pie.<br/><br/>　America's love of mobility has become an integral part of its national character, and it is still celebrated in books such as Blue Highways.  And anyone wanting to witness Americans pursuing the dream of other places either as a job or as a private quest for can still find an all-night diner where the patrons are more interesting than the menu."

                      "　When Columbus landed on the shores of the country now called Venezuela in the late 15th century, some historians estimate that the Native American population of North America stood at about five million.  By 1910, there were fewer than 200,000 \"Indians\" in North America. Formerly proud tribes such as the Iroquois, the Apache, and the Sioux have all but disappeared. Although the Native American population has increased approximately ten-fold, to approximately two million today, the story of Native America's encounter with white America has been filled with missed opportunities, betrayal, and tragic heroism.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the story of the great Algonquian chief, Powhatan.<br/><br/>　On May 13, 1607, the first permanent English colony in North America ─ Jamestown, Virginia ─ was settled by some 100 colonists on the left bank of what was then called the \"River of Powhatan.\"  At this same time the Algonquians, the dominant Native American tribe in the area, was led by an individual called Wahunsonacock, who was later named Powhatan after his village. Wahunsonacock/Powhatan was known for his wisdom and strength and succeeded in uniting many tribes in his region.  The Algonquians under Powhatan were united in a confederacy consisting of nearly two-hundred villages stretching across the entire English seaboard of the United States.  As a chief, Powhatan first sought peace with the European colonists.  But he soon found himself drawn into a series of conflicts with an enemy who grew ever-stronger as Powhatan's people slowly lost their grip on their land and their way of life. <br/><br/>　The Jamestown colonists initially found the New World unbearably harsh.  They lacked both the crops and the knowledge necessary to survive the bitter winter climate.  In 1608 Captain John Smith traveled with a group of colonists to meet with Powhatan, who offered to exchange corn for weapons.  Smith, distrustful of Powhatan's motives, refused the trade.  Powhatan and his people eventually provided the starving colonists with food nonetheless, teaching them how to raise \"Indian corn\" ─ a grain accepted only with reluctance by the Europeans ─ and also teaching them how to construct wigwams.  Even with such assistance, however, nearly half of Jamestown's 900 inhabitants <b>perished</b> during their first winter.<br/><br/>　More colonists came to Jamestown to replace those who had died, and they came with instructions to earn a profit for the British stockholders who were financing the establishment of the Jamestown colony.  With the need to produce quick earnings in mind, the colonists attacked the Powhatans, occupied their fields instead of clearing new fields of their own, and attempted to press some of the captured Native Americans into service as slaves.  The Powhatans counter-attacked in return, and relations between the two groups deteriorated.  Matters were worsened when, in an attempt to grow tobacco, the colonists seized additional Powhatan lands and, once again, the Native Americans counter-attacked, killing a number of the Europeans.<br/><br/>　In order to halt the Native American counter-attacks, the colonists took Chief Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, hostage.  Powhatan later learned that his beloved daughter had converted to Christianity and married a planter named John Rolfe, eventually sailing to England, where she died of smallpox.  Powhatan himself died a disillusioned man, feeling himself betrayed by the people he had helped to save."
